title: "Development Environment"
---

This guide steps you through configuring a local development environment for the Sentry server on macOS. If you're using another operating system the instructions are still roughly the same, but we don't maintain any official documentation for anything else for now.

## Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repo at [https://github.com/getsentry/sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) - or, your fork.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getsentry/sentry.git
cd sentry
```
