title: "Development Environment"
---

This guide steps you through configuring a local development environment for the Sentry server on macOS. If you're using another operating system the instructions are still roughly the same, but we don't maintain any official documentation for anything else for now.

## Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repo at [https://github.com/getsentry/sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) - or, your fork.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getsentry/sentry.git
cd sentry
```

You're going to be working out of the repository for the remainder of the setup.

## System Dependencies

Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), and then run `brew bundle` to install the various system packages as listed in sentry's `Brewfile`.

One thing that requires manual attention is `docker`, which should have just been installed. Open up Spotlight, search for "Docker" and start it. You should soon see the docker icon in your macOS toolbar. Docker will automatically run on system restarts, so this should be the only time you do this.

You can verify that Docker is running by running `docker ps`. If it doesn't error with something like `Error response from daemon: dial unix docker.raw.sock: connect: connection refused`, you're good to continue.

## Python

We utilize [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install and manage python versions. It should have already been installed earlier when you ran `brew bundle`.

To install the required versions of Python you'll need to run `pyenv install`. This will take a while, since your computer is actually compiling python!

After this, if you type `which python`, you should see something like `/usr/bin/python`... this means `python` will resolve to the system's python. You'll need to make some manual changes to your shell initialization files, if you want your shell to see pyenv's python.

If you're using bash, make sure your `~/.bash_profile` contains the following:

```bash {filename: ~/.bash_profile}
source ~/.bashrc

````

Configure your shell to load pyenv:

```bash {filename: ~/.bashrc}
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```

```bash {filename: ~/.zshrc} {tabTitle: Zsh}
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```


Once that's done, your shell needs to be reloaded. You can either reload it in-place, or close your terminal and start it again and cd into sentry. To reload it, run:

```bash
exec "$SHELL"
```

If it worked, running `which python` should result in something like `/Users/you/.pyenv/shims/python`.

### Virtual Environment

You're now ready to create a python virtual environment. Run:

```bash
python -m pip install virtualenv
python -m virtualenv .venv
```

And activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If everything worked, running `which python` should now result in something like `/Users/you/sentry/.venv/bin/python`.

## JavaScript

We use [volta](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta) to install and manage the version of Node.js that Sentry requires. To install Volta run:

```bash
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
```

The volta installer will tell you to "open a new terminal to start using Volta", but you don't have to! You can just reload your shell like before:

```bash
exec "$SHELL"
```
````
