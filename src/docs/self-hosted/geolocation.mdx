title: 'Self-Hosted Geolocation'
---

Sentry can use [MaxMind's free GeoLite2 database](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) to geolocate IP addresses, providing additional context for error events where the end-user's IP address is known, as well as for the session history of users logging into your Sentry installation. Our self-hosted offering bundles MaxMind's [`geoipupdate`](https://hub.docker.com/r/maxmindinc/geoipupdate) tool for initially downloading and periodically updating this dataset. To enable this functionality, you should [sign up for a free MaxMind account](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup), and then tell Sentry about your credentials via environment variables.

```shell
export GEOIPUPDATE_ACCOUNT_ID="012345"
export GEOIPUPDATE_LICENSE_KEY="foobar"
```

By default, self-hosted instances are configured to refresh the GeoLite2 database when the `geoipupdate` service first starts, and weekly thereafter. You can change the update frequency with an additional override:

```shell
export GEOIPUPDATE_ACCOUNT_ID="012345"
export GEOIPUPDATE_LICENSE_KEY="foobar"
export GEOIPUPDATE_FREQUENCY="24" # hours
```
