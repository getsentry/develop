title: "Logs rotation"
---

By default docker writes logs of a container to one log file which can be giant - tens of gigabytes.

To reduce a used space for logs you can 
 * modify docker-compose.yml file and add following logging settings into a common section for each container:

```
x-restart-policy: &restart_policy
  restart: unless-stopped
  logging:
    driver: "json-file"
    options:
      max-size: "20m"
      max-file: "10"
```

And docker daemon will automatically control size of a log file for each container from the yaml file: 20Mb * 10 = 200Mb for each container. <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#logging">Offical documentaion</a> about those settings.

 * modify a docker daemon <a href="https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/configure/"><code>log settings</code></a> to apply them to all newly created containers.
