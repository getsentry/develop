This page provides a guide to help users secure their Sentry deployments and make the most out of Sentry. I don't know what else to say here so let's do this (yeah I'm gonna change this sentence later).

## Recommended system resource

Depending on your usage, required system resource to run Sentry may varies.

## Enabling HTTPS

Explain why do we need HTTPS

## Expose Only Ingest Endpoint Publicly

Sometimes, there are self-hosted deployments that requires the dashboard to be accessed via internal network. But, they also need to provide public Sentry ingestion endpoint for client devices. You can expose these endpoints publicly:

- `/api/ingest` 
- Put some more here...

## Using Dedicated Load Balancer

Put some words here...

### NGINX

Put some NGINX config here... Give link to tune NGINX.

### Caddy

Put some Caddy config here...

### Traefik

Put some Traefik config here...

### HAProxy

Put some HAProxy config here...

## Firewall

It is always good to protect your incoming network to prevent multiple network-level attack.

For Debian/Ubuntu-based, it is recommended to use `ufw`.

For RHEL-based (RedHat, Fedora, CentOS, Rocky Linux, Alma Linux), it is recommended to use `firewalld`.
