title: "Issue Platform"

The Issue Platform allows developers to create new issue types from data streams.

To use the Issue Platform you need to

1. Write a Detector
2. Register an issue type
3. Start Occurrences to the Issue Platform


## Writing a Detector
The first step to introducing a new issue type to Sentry is to determine what type of issue you want to detect. It can be from any data stream, as long as you can produce an 
Occurrence representing the issue [link to occurrence schema]

## Register an Issue Type
To register a new issue type you need to subclass `GroupType` https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/ef76b0765f6c057af12b1cd0dc2de6b42a938c02/src/sentry/issues/grouptype.py#L98-L108

When registering the class, set the following required attributes on the class:
- type_id: A unique integer to identify your issue type.
- slug: A unique slug to identify your issue type. Used to search by issue type in the issue stream
- description: A human readable description of your issue type [include where this is used]
- category: The overall category that your issue type belongs to. [include docs on creating a category]

You may also set these optional attributes:
- noise_config: A `NoiseConfig` that allows you to set policy on how many times a fingerprint must occur in a period of time before an issue is created
  
TODO: Include docs about releasing and explain how `- released: bool = False` is used

Here's an example issue type:
```
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ProfileFileIOGroupType(GroupType):
    type_id = 2001
    slug = "profile_file_io_main_thread"
    description = "File I/O on Main Thread"
    category = GroupCategory.PROFILE.value
```



## Send Occurrences to the Issue Platform
If operating within the Sentry codebase, you can call `sentry.issues.produce_occurrence_to_kafka` https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/src/sentry/issues/producer.py#L28-L30
and pass in the Occurrence, and optionally the `Event` data.

If operating from a separate service pass a json payload with this format:
