title: Dynamic Sampling
---

Dynamic Sampling expands the SDKs' sampling concept to the Sentry ingestion pipeline. Clients send a higher ratio - ideally all of their traffic - to Sentry, and the decision of whether to keep (i.e. sample) or drop data is made on Sentry's servers.

## Goals of Dynamic Sampling

### Get Value Out of the Box

Sentry automatically biases data retention based on what we believe is more valuable for most users.

### Prioritize Based on Your Needs

Sentry provides a mechanism for users to express priorities and then adjusts data retention as much as is practical to honor them.

### Value at Any Scale

We have a full view of your application and can accurately show performance metrics, detect trends and performance issues from 100% of your events.
