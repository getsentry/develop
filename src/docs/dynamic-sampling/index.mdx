title: Dynamic Sampling
---

Dynamic Sampling expands the SDKs' sampling concept to the Sentry ingestion pipeline. Clients send a higher ratio - ideally all of their traffic - to Sentry, and the **decision of whether to keep or drop data is made on Sentry's servers**.

The goals of Dynamic Sampling are to:
- **Prioritize based on your needs**: Sentry provides a mechanism to express a set of rules and then adjusts data retention as much as is practical to honor them.
- **Value at any scale**: Sentry has a full view of your application and can accurately show performance metrics, detect trends and performance issues from 100% of your events.
