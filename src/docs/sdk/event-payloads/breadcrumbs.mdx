title: Breadcrumbs Interface
---

Sentry uses _breadcrumbs_ to create a trail of events that happened prior to an issue. These events are very similar to traditional logs but can record more rich structured data.

This page provides technical information about a breadcrumb structure. You can read an overview of manual breadcrumb recording and customization on our [Breadcrumbs](https://docs.sentry.io/enriching-error-data/breadcrumbs/) sentry docs page.

At Sentry an event payload contains a property called `entries` that is an array of objects. Each object contains two properties `type` and `data`. The property `type` being a string and the property `data` being an object containing the property `values`. The `values` property is of type array.

When the `type` of an entry is of type “breadcrumbs”, the `data.values` array may contain one more objects with following properties:

`event_id` (optional)

Hexadecimal string representing a uuid4 value. The length is exactly 32 characters. Dashes are not allowed. Has to be lowercase.

`type` (optional)

The type of breadcrumb.

By default, all breadcrumbs are recorded as `default`, which makes them appear as a Debug entry, but Sentry provides other types that influence how the breadcrumbs are rendered. For more information, see the [description of recognized breadcrumb types](#breadcrumb-types).

`category` (optional)

A dotted string indicating what the crumb is or from where it comes. Typically it is a module name or a descriptive string. For instance, `ui.click` could be used to indicate that a click happened in the UI or flask could be used to indicate that the event originated in the Flask framework.

Internally we render some crumb’s color and icon based on the provided category. For more information, see the [description of recognized breadcrumb types](#breadcrumb-types).

`message` (optional)

A string describing the event rendered as text with all whitespace preserved. Often used as a drop-in for a traditional log message.

`data` (optional)

A key-value mapping of metadata around the event. This is often used instead of the message, but may be used in addition. Sentry.io will display all the data sent.

`level` (optional)

This defines the severity level of the breadcrumb. Allowed values are, from highest to lowest: `fatal`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, and `debug`. Levels are used in the UI to emphasize and deemphasize the crumb. Defaults to `info`.

`timestamp` (recommended)

A timestamp representing when the breadcrumb occurred. The format is either a string as defined in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) or a numeric (integer or float) value representing the number of seconds that have elapsed since the [Unixepoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).  
Breadcrumbs are most useful when they include a timestamp, as it creates a timeline leading up to an event `expection/error`.

## Breadcrumb Types

Below are descriptions of individual breadcrumb types, and what their `data` properties look like.

### `default`

Describes a generic breadcrumb. This is typically a log message or user-generated breadcrumb. The `data` part is entirely undefined and as such, completely rendered as a key/value table.

```json
{
  "type": "default",
  "category": "started",
  "data": undefined,
  "event_id": "null",
  "level": "info",
  "message": "this is a message",
  "timestamp": "2020-08-28T07:19:20.926196Z"
}
```

### `debug`

This is typically a log message. The `data` part is entirely undefined and as such, completely rendered as a key/value table.

_Internally we convert events with the category `console` to the type `debug`._

```json
{
  "type": "debug",
  "category": "started",
  "data": null,
  "event_id": null,
  "level": "info",
  "message": "this is a message",
  "timestamp": "2020-08-28T07:29:37Z"
}
```

### `exception`

The occurrence of an exception.

_Internally, we don't get the exception data from the breadcrumb entry, but from the exception entry._

```json
{
  "entries": [
    { "type": "exception", "data": {...} },
    { "type": "breadcrumbs", "data": {...} }]
}
```

The `data` object of an exception will always contain the `mechanism` property describing if the exception was handled or not.

```json
{
  "mechanism": { "type": "generic", "handled": true },
  "module": null,
  "rawStacktrace": null,
  "stacktrace": null,
  "threadId": null,
  "type": "TypeError",
  "value": "Failed to fetch"
}
```

### `error`

An error that occurred before the exception.

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "category": "error",
  "data": null,
  "event_id": null,
  "level": "error",
  "message": "this is a message",
  "timestamp": "2020-08-28T07:30:37Z"
}
```

### `navigation`

A navigation event can be a URL change in a web application, or a UI transition in a mobile or desktop application, etc.

_Internally we convert categories with the string `navigation` to the type `navigation`._

Its `data` property has the following sub-properties:

`from` (Required)

A string representing the original application state / location.

`to` (Required)

A string representing the new application state / location.

```json
{
  "type": "navigation",
  "timestamp": "2016-04-20T20:55:53.845Z",
  "data": {
    "from": "/login",
    "to": "/dashboard"
  }
}
```

### `http`

This represents an HTTP request transmitted from your application. This could be an AJAX request from a web application, or a server-to-server HTTP request to an API service provider, etc.

Its `data` property has the following sub-properties:

`url` (optional)

The request URL.

`method` (optional)

The HTTP request method.

`status_code` (optional)

The HTTP status code of the response.

`reason` (optional)

A text that describes the status code.

```json
{
  "type": "http",
  "data": {
    "url": "http://example.com/api/1.0/users",
    "method": "GET",
    "status_code": 200,
    "reason": "OK"
  },
  "timestamp": "2016-04-20T20:55:53.845Z"
}
```

### `info`

Information that could help you identify the root cause of the issue or who the error happened for.

```json
{
  "type": "info",
  "category": "started",
  "data": null,
  "event_id": null,
  "level": "info",
  "message": "this is a message",
  "timestamp": "2020-08-28T07:28:37Z"
}
```

### `query`

This represents a query that was made in your application.

```json
{
  "type": "query",
  "category": "started",
  "data": null,
  "event_id": null,
  "level": "info",
  "message": "this is a message",
  "timestamp": "2020-08-28T07:27:37Z"
}
```

### `transaction`

Describes a tracing event.

_Internally we convert categories with the dotted strings `sentry.transaction` and `sentry.event` to the type `transaction`._

```json
{
  "type": "default",
  "category": "sentry.transaction",
  "data": null,
  "event_id": null,
  "level": "info",
  "message": "this is a message",
  "timestamp": "2020-08-10T09:24:17.408886Z"
}
```

### `ui`

A user interaction with your app's UI.

_Internally we convert categories with the dotted string `ui.*` to the type `ui`._

```json
{
  "type": "default",
  "category": "ui.click",
  "data": null,
  "event_id": null,
  "level": "info",
  "message": "div.css-1bgr1m3-NavSection.eqosaaj0 > a.css-17jlceh-StyledNavItem.e1o2rm130",
  "timestamp": "2020-08-10T09:26:16.709631Z"
}
```

### `user`

A user interaction with your app's UI.

This type is very similar to the type `ui` described above. The difference is that we do not convert it's category internally, but we use it's type.

```json
{
  "type": "user",
  "category": "category",
  "data": null,
  "event_id": null,
  "level": "info",
  "message": "div.css-1bgr1m3-NavSection.eqosaaj0 > a.css-17jlceh-StyledNavItem.e1o2rm130",
  "timestamp": "2020-08-10T09:23:16.709631Z"
}
```

## Examples

The following example illustrates the breadcrumbs part of the <Link to="/sdk/event-payloads/">event
payload</Link> and omits other properties for simplicity.

```json
{
  "breadcrumbs": {
    "values": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2016-04-20T20:55:53.845Z",
        "message": "Something happened",
        "category": "log",
        "data": {
          "foo": "bar",
          "blub": "blah"
        }
      },
      {
        "timestamp": "2016-04-20T20:55:53.847Z",
        "type": "navigation",
        "data": {
          "from": "/login",
          "to": "/dashboard"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
