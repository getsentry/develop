Data handling is the standardized context in how we want SDKs help users filter data.

## Sensitive Data

SDKs should not include PII or other sensitive data in the payload by default.

- [_send-default-pii_](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/options/#send-default-pii) is **disabled by default**, meaning that data that is naturally sensitive is not sent by default. That means, for example:

  - When attaching HTTP requests to events, "raw" bodies (bodies which cannot be parsed as JSON or formdata) are removed, and known sensitive headers such as `Authorization` or `Cookies` are removed too.

  - User-specific information (e.g. the current user ID according to the used webframework) is not sent at all.

  - On desktop applications, the username logged in the device is not included.

  - SDKs don't send `{{auto}}` as `user.ip`. This instructs the server to keep the connection's IP address.

*Note* that if a user explicitly sets a request on the scope, nothing is stripped from that request. The above rules only apply to integrations that come with the SDK.

Before sending events to Sentry, the SDKs should invokes callbacks. That allows users to remove any sensitive data client-side.

- `before-send` and `event-processors` can be used to register a callback with custom logic to remove sensitive data.

### Auto instrumentation 

App state can be critical to help developers reproduce bugs. For that reason, SDKs often collect app state and append to events.

When attaching data that could potentially include sensitive data or PII, it's important to:

- Add a note on the docs to notify developers.
- [Mark that part of the protocol on Relay](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/1383) as such. This allows [data scrubbing](https://docs.sentry.io/product/relay/) to run on those fields.

Some examples of auto instrumentation that could attach sensitive data:

- A SQL integration that includes the query. If a user doesn't use parameterized queries, and appends sensitive data to it, the SDK could include that in the event payload.
- Desktop apps including window title.
- A Web framework routing instrumentation attaching route `to` and `from`.

## Variable Size

Fields in the event payload that allow user-specified or dynamic values are restricted in size. This applies to most meta data fields, such as variables in a stack trace, as well as contexts, tags and extra data:

- Mappings of values (such as HTTP data, extra data, etc) are limited to 50 item pairs.
- Event IDs are limited to 36 characters and must be valid UUIDs.
- Tag keys are limited to 32 characters.
- Tag values are limited to 200 characters.
- Culprits are limited to 200 characters.
- Context objects are limited to 8kB.
- Individual extra data items are limited to 16kB. Total extra data is limited to 256kb.
- Messages are limited to 8192 characters.
- HTTP data (the body) is limited to 8kB. Always trim HTTP data before attaching it to the event.
- Stack traces are limited to 50 frames. If more are sent, data will be removed from the middle of the stack.

Additionally, size limits apply to all store requests for the total size of the request, event payload, and attachments. Sentry rejects all requests exceeding these limits. Please refer the following resources for the exact size limits:
