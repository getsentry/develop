title: "Time to Initial Display/Time to Full Display"
---

We recommend implementing this feature for mobile and desktop SDKs.

The current screen load transactions timings are not reliable to understand the time spent in the screen creation.
This is because they wait for any span created in the meantime, including any file I/O or network request.
Time to Initial Display and Time to Full Display are spans added to the screen load transactions,
which can be used to show more accurate information on the time spent in the screen creation.
Being spans, they don't impact on user quota.

They start as soon as a new screen is created, as long as the screen load auto-generated transactions are enabled.

## Time to Initial Display

Time to Initial Display is a span with operation `ui.load.initial_display` which finishes automatically
when the screen draws its first frame. It's controlled automatically by the SDK and doesn't
require any manual intervention from the user.


## Time to Full Display

Time to Full Display is a span with operation `ui.load.full_display` which is finished manually through
the `Sentry.reportFullDisplayed` static API. This feature has to be enabled by setting the SDK config
option `enableTimeToFullDisplayTracing`. Remember that the screen load transactions wait for spans to finish,
so the transaction will run until the user calls the API. So we recommend this feature to be disabled by default.

The following section explain the possible scenarios of the Time to Full Display.

The specification is written in the [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/).

```Gherkin
Scenario: Option disabled
    Given an ongoing screen load/navigation transaction
    Then the Full Display span is not started
    When the user calls the manual API `reportFullDisplayed`
    Then the SDK ignores the call

Scenario: Option enabled
    Given the enableTimeToFullDisplayTracing option is enabled
    When the SDK creates a new screen load transaction
    Then the Full Display span is started

Scenario: Activity displayed
    Given an ongoing Full Display span
    When the user calls the API `reportFullDisplayed`
    Then the SDK finishes the span
    And sets the status to ok

Scenario: API not called
    Given an ongoing Full Display span
    When the user doesn't call the API `reportFullDisplayed` in 30 seconds
    Then the SDK finishes the span
    And sets the status to deadline_exceeded

Scenario: API called too early
    Given an ongoing Full Display span and an ongoing Initial Display span
    When the user calls the API `reportFullDisplayed`
    Then the SDK finishes the Full Display span
    And
    When the Initial Display span is finished
    Then the SDK adjusts the Full Display span end timestamp to the Initial Display span end timestamp

Scenario: Another screen load/navigation transaction occurs
    Given an ongoing Full Display span
    When a new screen load/navigation transaction is started
    Then the SDK finishes the Full Display span
    And sets the status to deadline_exceeded

Scenario: No ongoing screen load transaction
    Given there is no active screen load transaction
    When the user calls the manual API `reportFullDisplayed`
    Then the SDK ignores the call
