title: "Span Operations"
---

Span operations are a short code identifying the type of operation the span is measuring. Span operations are low cardinality attributes - they should be as general as possible while still being human readable and useful.

Operations are expected to follow [OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/README.md) as much as possible.

Below is a table containing a list of span operations that are recommended to be used.

Operations are expected to generally take the form: `CATEGORY.ACTION`, where the categories and actions can have optional identifiers. For example, a redis database operation takes the form `db.sql.query`, where `db` is the category, `sql` is the category identifier, and `query` is the action. Another example is a mobile app rendering it's screen. It would have the operation `ui.load.hot`, where `ui` is the category, `load` is the action, and `hot` is the action identifier.

It's important to keep categories consistent between sdks and integrations as they are used by Sentry in the [Operations Breakdown](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/tracing/event-detail/#operations-breakdown) feature. For example, both `db.init` and `db.query` will be categorized as database operations (`db`). The default operations breakdown config can be seen [here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/809b7fe54c6f06cc1e4c503cf83ded896472a011/src/sentry/projectoptions/defaults.py#L74).

Due to use of categories in the Sentry product, span categories are expected to be low cardinality data. **Categories should not be auto-generated**. SDK developers should feel free to automatically generate the actions and identifiers for span operations.

Having both a category and action is recommended. Operations should be lowercased.

# List of Operations

The following tables contain examples of operations used by the SDKs and Sentry product. The usage column in the table contains examples of using that operation category, but are not hard recommendations for operation usage. As long as categories stay consistent, SDK developers are free to choose actions and identifiers that best match the use case they are instrumenting.
