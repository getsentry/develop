title: 'Assets Module'

The javascript SDK should automatically instrument most assets fetched by the application. This includes images, stylesheets, scripts, and other assets. But if you may wish to instrument assets manually.

## Span conventions

### Span Operations

| Span OP           | Description                             |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `resource.script` | Javscript was fetched by the browser    |
| `resource.css`    | A Stylesheet was fetched by the browser |
| `resource.img`    | An Image was fetched by the browser     |

### Span Description

The description of an asset span should be the full URL which is was fetched from, e.g. `https://cdn.com/main.hash123.js`.

### Span Data

| Data Key                               | Type   | Description                                                                      | Conditions                          |
| :------------------------------------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| `http.response_content_length`         | int    | encoded size of the asset in `bytes` (what is sent over the network)             | required on all asset operations    |
| `http.decoded_response_content_length` | int    | the decoded size of the asset in `bytes`                                         | recommended on all asset operations |
| `http.response_transfer_size`          | int    | the size of the encoded asset plus the response headers in `bytes`               | recommended on all asset operations |
| `resource.render_blocking_status`      | string | wether the resource blocks UI rendering, values are 'non-blocking' or 'blocking' | recommended on all asset operations |

## Instrumentation

Once an application fetches an asset, the SDK creates a new span based on the operation.

**Example**

Consider a basic HTML file that fetches a single script:

```html
<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.com/main.hash123.js"></script>
</head>
```

Should result in the following span, assuming the request was successful:

```json
{
  "description": "https://cdn.com/main.hash123.js",
  "op": "resource.script",
  "data": {
    "http.decoded_response_content_length": 123,
    "http.response_content_length": 123,
    "http.response_transfer_size": 123,
    "server.address": "cdn.com",
    ... other span properties
  }
}
```
