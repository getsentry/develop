title: "sentry vs. getsentry"
---

You'll find numerous references to both `sentry` and `getsentry` in our documentation. Both are [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) apps, but [`sentry` is open](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) and `getsentry` is closed. What's in which?

The main thing to emphasize is that all of our product features—[Issues](https://docs.sentry.io/product/issues/), [Performance](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/), [Dashboards](https://docs.sentry.io/product/dashboards/), and [such](https://docs.sentry.io/product/)—are implemented and available in `sentry`, the open component. It's really important to us that we're not an "open core" company that hides key functionality behind a paywall. [Sentry is as open-source as we can make it](https://open.sentry.io/licensing/).

So what's in `getsentry`, then? Billing and account management features for [our SaaS](https://sentry.io/). Again, both `sentry` and `getsentry` are Django apps. `getsentry` is the app we deploy to production. It imports the `sentry` app, adds some routes and models, and re-exports it.  Additionally, `sentry` is littered with "hooks" via Django signals, which `getsentry` subscribes to.  There's a homegrown feature-flagging system vendored into `sentry`, which has a hardcoded table of features (`SENTRY_FEATURES`).  [Self-hosted](/self-hosted/) installs can control feature availability using this system. In `getsentry` a different "feature flag handler" is registered that flips flags based on our [billing plans](https://sentry.io/pricing/). There are some other swappable backends (`sentry.nodestore`, `sentry.quotas`) that `getsentry` utilizes.

For example, there's a Django signal called `event_received` in `sentry` that is triggered when an event is saved. If you're running self-hosted then nothing is subscribed to this hook, but in `getsentry` in SaaS our counting machinery for billing runs when that signal fires.

As to the CLI, you can often swap the `sentry` CLI for the `getsentry` CLI and they'll behave the same. In other cases, we have attempted to call out differences in behavior.

As to settings, `getsentry`'s settings are configured in `getsentry/conf/settings/defaults.py`.  Additional environment specific overrides are found in files matching the environment name. For example, local development is found in `getsentry/conf/settings/dev.py`.

If you're not part of the Sentry team, you won't have access to develop on the `getsentry` codebase and you can ignore the related documentation.
