title: "Metrics"
---

Sentry provides an abstraction called ‘metrics’ which is used for internal monitoring, generally timings and various counters.

The default backend simply discards them (though some values are still kept in the internal time series database).

## Statsd Backend

```python
SENTRY_METRICS_BACKEND = 'sentry.metrics.statsd.StatsdMetricsBackend'
SENTRY_METRICS_OPTIONS = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'port': 8125,
}
```

## Datadog Backend

Datadog will require you to install the `datadog` package into your Sentry environment:

```bash
$ pip install datadog
```

In your `sentry.conf.py`:

```python
SENTRY_METRICS_BACKEND = 'sentry.metrics.datadog.DatadogMetricsBackend'
SENTRY_METRICS_OPTIONS = {
    'api_key': '...',
    'app_key': '...',
    'tags': {},
}
```

Once installed, the Sentry metrics will be emitted to the [Datadog REST API](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/?lang=python#post-time-series-points) over HTTPS.

## DogStatsD Backend

Using the DogStatsD backend requires a [Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/) to be running with the DogStatsD backend (on by default at port 8125).

You must also install the `datadog` Python package into your Sentry environment:

```bash
$ pip install datadog
```

In your `sentry.conf.py`:

```python
SENTRY_METRICS_BACKEND = 'sentry.metrics.dogstatsd.DogStatsdMetricsBackend'
SENTRY_METRICS_OPTIONS = {
    'statsd_host': 'localhost',
    'statsd_port': 8125,
    'tags': {},
}
```

Once configured, the metrics backend will emit to the DogStatsD server and then flushed periodically to Datadog over HTTPS.

## Logging Backend

The `LoggingBackend` reports all operations to the `sentry.metrics` logger. In addition to the metric name and value, log messages also include extra data such as the `instance` and `tags` values which can be displayed using a custom formatter.

```python
SENTRY_METRICS_BACKEND = 'sentry.metrics.logging.LoggingBackend'

LOGGING['loggers']['sentry.metrics'] = {
    'level': 'DEBUG',
    'handlers': ['console:metrics'],
    'propagate': False,
}

LOGGING['formatters']['metrics'] = {
    'format': '[%(levelname)s] %(message)s; instance=%(instance)r; tags=%(tags)r',
}

LOGGING['handlers']['console:metrics'] = {
    'level': 'DEBUG',
    'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
    'formatter': 'metrics',
}
```

## Notes on Metrics

When emitting metrics you need to be careful about cardinality.  Particularly for
metrics that are supposed to be sent to Datadog, at our scale there can be large
server bills heading our way if a high cardinality tag is emitted.  Examples for
high cardinality tags are:

* `event_id`, `request_id` etc.: these are unique values, absolutely pointless and
  if one were to emit them at out scale: very, very expensive.
* `project_id`, `org_id`: for common operations that happen across the entire user
  base: still a very bad idea.  Maybe they are acceptable for very rare circumstances
  or things that only happen for a small segment of the user base (eg: when you are
  tracking a beta feature with a small user base, but even in that case probably
  a horrible idea).
